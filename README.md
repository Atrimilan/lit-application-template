# ðŸš€ Welcome to this template!

Start by installing node modules with the following:

```
npm install
```
Then you can either start working on a local [Web Dev server](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web):

```
npm run watch
```

Or simply build the project to the `dist` folder:

```
npm run build
```
